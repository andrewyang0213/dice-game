# Liar's Dice Game (In-Progress)

This project uses the TKinter library from Python to build a GUI for the Liar's Dice Game where the user can play against a computer that uses machine learning to gain an edge over the player over a large sample of games.

The computer follows a Markov Chain decision-making construction that stores the player's previous moves and bluff frequency to predict its next best move based on the player's propensity for bluffing in different situations and rounds of the game.
